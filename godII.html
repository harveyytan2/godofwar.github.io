                    God of War II is a hack-and-slash action-adventure video game and the sequel to the God of War video game for the PlayStation 2. It was released in North America on March 13, 2007, in Europe on April 27, and on May 3, 2007 in Australia. This game follows the Spartan warrior and a former demigod, Kratos, the new God of War after defeating Ares in the first game, was tricked and betrayed by Zeus, the King of the Gods, who stripped Kratos from his godhood and kills him. But after being saved by Gaia who is one of the Titans and the narrator of the series, Kratos begins his quest to avert his betrayal, restore back his godhood and his powers, and exact revenge against Zeus.<br><br>

                <p class="paragraph">
                    God of War II takes place shortly after the events of God of War: Ghost of Sparta, but over 13 years after the events of God of War; Kratos, after defeating Ares, has become the new God of War, but unfortunately, he has not been accepted by the other Gods due to his ruthless treatment of the other Greek city-states. Kratos is still haunted by memories of the deeds from his past while working under Ares. He finds enjoyment the only way he can, by leading and aiding his Spartan Army in conquering Greece. Athena pleads that Kratos stop, telling him that she cannot protect him much longer from the wrath of Olympus and that he should not turn his back on her because it was she who made him a God. Kratos replies that he owes nothing to her and descends to the battle of Rhodes to assist his Spartan Army. <br><br>

Kratos joins the fight as a God and begins destroying the city of Rhodes. After a short while, Kratos notices an Eagle, who Kratos believes to be Athena in disguise. The bird robs him of his godly height, infusing them into the Colossus of Rhodes and bringing it to life to kill Kratos.<br><br>

After a protracted conflict with a golden giant statue that rages across the city, Zeus offers Kratos the Blade of Olympus, which Zeus himself used to win the Great War between the Gods and the Titans. At Zeus' behest, Kratos infuses the Blade with his godhood, rendering him Mortal but enabling him to destroy the Colossus from the inside. However, Kratos soon finds himself mortally wounded after being crushed by the severed, falling hand of the Statue.<br><br>

Kratos realizes he must retrieve the Blade of Olympus to save himself. As he slowly gets up and limps his way to the sword, Zeus reveals himself as the Eagle that stole his powers, and he betrayed Kratos so that his fate will not be the same as Ares'. Zeus demands him to surrender but when Kratos refused, Zeus then stabs him with the Blade of Olympus into Kratos' stomach, killing him after he refuses to forever serve the Gods and wiping out all the Spartans & Rhodes Soldiers.<br><br>

However, as Kratos is being dragged towards an eternity of torment in the Underworld, he is saved by Gaia, the mother of the Titans and the franchise's narrator, who offers an alliance. Kratos, who still have some his little remaining powers in him, escapes the Underworld and is bidden by Gaia to find the Sisters of Fate in order to change his past, regain back his godly powers as well as his status, as the "God of War", and then avert his betrayal and kill Zeus. She then gives Kratos the aid of the magical horse Pegasus to traverse the distance to the Sisters.<br><br>

Kratos then makes his way to the remaining sister, Clotho, who operates and defends the Loom of Fate, which rules the lives of mortals and Gods alike. Pinning Clotho's hands to the ground, Kratos manages to impale her skull with a giant swinging blade-like pendulum, killing her. With the defeat of the three Sisters of Fates, Kratos granted himself control over the Loom and his own destiny. Kratos, finally having his powers back and becoming the God of War once again, goes back to his death at Zeus' hands in Rhodes, saving his past self and reclaiming the Blade of Olympus from a surprised Zeus, inciting a lengthy battle with the King of the Gods. At the end of the fight, Zeus stuns Kratos with a powerful lighting storm, Kratos then announces untruthfully that he surrenders. As Zeus is about to kill Kratos, who then deflects the blow using an energy blast and pins Zeus' hands to the rock with the Blades of Athena. Kratos then takes the Blade of Olympus and begins driving it into Zeus' chest exactly how Zeus stabbed him with.<br><br>

Before he could finish, Athena arrives and defends Zeus, however, Kratos is angered by her betrayal and interference as Athena announces her intentions to protect Olympus. The badly wounded Zeus attempts to escape, while stating Kratos has started a war, he can't possibly win as the Sisters of Fate already predicted his victory. However, Kratos breaks free of the defending Athena, charging towards Zeus with the Blade of Olympus, but Athena sacrifices herself by impaling herself upon the Blade, granting Zeus escape. A stunned Kratos asks her why she did this as the dying Goddess reveals that Zeus' actions are meant to break the Cycle of Patricide as a another new son starts killing his father, which goes back to Cronos killing Uranus, and Zeus killing Cronos. Before he can kill him, Zeus had hoped to break the cycle - thus confirming that Kratos is, in fact, Zeus' own son, which reveals that Kratos is a demigod right before he became fully a God after slaughtering Ares, and she begs him to relent in his quest for vengeance.<br><br>

Kratos returns to the Loom, as the room its in collapses around him and he goes back in time once more to the Great War of the Gods and Titans. He calls to Gaia and she announces that the Titans were expecting him and then Kratos explains they can win the Great War in his time.<br><br>

As a defeated Zeus encourages his fellow Gods to help him kill the now rogue Kratos, every single Titan to ever exist returns to Kratos' time in their prime forms (due to Kratos going back in time to when all of the Titan were at their strongest to give Kratos his best chance of winning), angry and vengeful they climb Mount Olympus to kill Zeus and the Gods. Leading them, Kratos announces to Zeus "Zeus! Your son has returned, I bring the destruction of Olympus!!!", thus leading directly into the events of God of War III.<br><br>
